5. **Security**: Are there obvious security vulnerabilities?
6. **Accessibility**: Are there obvious accessibility issues?
7. **Scalability**: Are there obvious scalability issues?
8. **Maintainability**: Is the code easy to maintain?

10. **Documentation**: Is the code well-documented?
11. **Clean code**: Is the code clean and readable?
